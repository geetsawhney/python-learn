# Format Phone Number
#
# We are given a string S representing a phone number, which we would like to
# reformat. String S consists of N characters: digits, spaces and/or dashes. It contains at least two digits.
#
# Spaces and dashes in string S can be ignored. We want to reformat the given
# phone number in such a way that the digits are grouped in blocks of length three,
# separated by single dashes. If necessary, the final block or the last two blocks can be of length two.
#
# For example, given string S = "00-44 48 5555 8361", we would like to format it
# as "004-448-555-583-61".
#
# Write a function that, given a string S representing a phone number, returns
# this phone number reformatted as described above.
#
# For example, given S = "00-44 48 5555 8361", the function should
# return "004-448-555-583-61". Given S ="0 - 22 1985--324",the function should
# return "022-198-53-24". Given S = "555372654", the function should return "555-372-654".
#
# Assume that N is an integer within the range [2..100]; string S consists only
# of digits (0âˆ’9), spaces and/or dashes (-); string S contains at least two digits.
