# Cards War
#
# Alice and Bob are playing a game called Cards War. Both players have one deck
# containing N cards each. The hierarchy of card values is as follows:
# ace(marked with the symbol A), king(K), queen(Q), jack(J), ten(T)
# and from nine to two(9âˆ’2).
#
# The game is played in turns. In every turn, each player draws one card from
# the top of their deck. The player who draws the higher card wins the current
# turn. If both players draw the same card, nobody wins and they proceed to the
#  next turn. After each turn, the drawn cards are put aside and not used again
#  in the current game.
#
# Let's consider a single game, where: Alice's deck consists
# of(from top to bottom): ace, five, eight, six, queen, king
# Bob's deck consists of(from top to bottom): jack, jack, six, five, three, king.
#
# Alice wins the first, third, fourth and fifth turns. Bob wins the second turn.
# Note that nobody wins the last turn since both players draw the same card(king).
#
# Write a function that, given two non - empty strings A, B consisting of N card
# symbols(representing Alice's and Bob's decks, respectively), returns the number of turns that Alice will win.
#
# For example, given "A586QK" and "JJ653K", your function should return 4, as
# explained above.
#
# Given "23A84Q" and "K2Q25J", your function should also return 4, since Alice
# wins the second, third, fourth and sixth turns.
#
# Assume that N is an integer within the range[1..1, 000]
# strings A and B consist only of the following characters: 2 - 9, T, J, Q, K and / or A
# strings A and B are of equal length.
